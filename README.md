# AOL_DataStructure
This was a final group project as a requirement for the Data Structure course. In this project, I served as the lead programmer, responsible for developing the entire program and assisting in preparing the final report.

The project required us to create a simple program implementing core data structure concepts, including:
Input: Adding new data entries.
View: Displaying data in various ordersâ€”inorder, preorder, postorder, viewing certain data, or searching for specific data.
Delete: Removing selected data entries.
Exit: Closing the program.

For this project, we chose to implement an AVL tree to manage a school data system. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of fundamental data structures and their practical applications in building efficient systems.
